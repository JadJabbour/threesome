===========

threesomeJS(_3.js) is a front-end javascript library that supports a web architecture heavily 
depending on separation between Data, Design and Functionality. Where the HTML templates can 
be hosted on server X1, the data/api on server X2 and the functionality (javascript for the pages)
on server X3. It's purpose is -for the time- experimental only.

PS: the project is the example itself.
