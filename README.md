threesomeJS ( _3 ):
-----------------------
	_3 (threesomeJS) is for experimental purposes. Using it, one can build web-apps 
	with un-conventional/experimental architectures. The source is not minified in
	order to allow anyone at any point to manipulate the way it behaves; And do
	share with me your changes and thoughts either via twitter or via GitHub.

	I hope someone finds this useful and/or playfull! :)

	Peer review is more than welcome, your thoughts and ideas about this
	(as harsh as they are) are very important to me.
